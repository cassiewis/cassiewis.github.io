                Welcome to Serenity by Jan. I handcraft timeless products and fragrances inspired by nature, memories 
                and imaginary places. With candles, I support the intention of women to live positive, mindful life.
                Make your intentions real with candles that promote engery, happiness and wholeness. My vibe is clean, 
                earth and itentional.<br><br><br><br>
